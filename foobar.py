# Write code that loops through the numbers between 1 and 30 (inclusive) and
# - prints "foo" if the number is divisible by 3
# - prints "bar" if the number is divisible by 5
# - prints "foobar" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
# - prints the number otherwise
#
# The output for each number should be printed on a separate line. You should 
# not print any additional messages.
#
# For example, for the numbers 1 to 5, your code should print
# 
# 1
# 2
# foo
# 4
# bar

def foobar():
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    # You can delete the line below when you start adding code
    pass
