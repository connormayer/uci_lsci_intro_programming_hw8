# Write code that asks the user to type in a word and then prints out the 
# number of vowels in the word. We will define vowels as the set 
# {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'} (but not 'y'). For example, the input 'hello' 
# should print '2' (or whatever message you want to print containing that 
# number).
#
# Your code should work with both upper and lowercase characters.
