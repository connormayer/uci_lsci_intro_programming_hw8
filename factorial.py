# Write a program that asks a user for a non-negative integer and then prints 
# out the factorial of that number. The factorial of a number k is:
#
#         k! = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
#
# Additionally
# 
#        0! = 1
# 
# You should get input from the user using the input function. It's ok if your
# program crashes or does something strange if the user inputs something that
# is not non-negative integer.
