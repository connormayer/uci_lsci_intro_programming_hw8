# Write code that asks the user to input a year (CE) and then prints 'leap year' 
# if it is a leap year and 'regular year' if it is not (you can print any 
# message you want but it must contain these phrases).
#
# How do you know if a year is a leap year? Here are the rules:
# - If a year is divisble by 4, it is a leap year
# - The exception to this is 'century years' (years ending in 00),
#   which must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
# 
# For example, the year 256 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4. The 
# year 800 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 and also 400. The year
# 600 is not a leap year, because even though it is divisible by 4, it is not
# divisible by 400.
#
# Your code should get input from the user using the input function.

def leap_year():
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    # You can delete the line below when you start adding code
